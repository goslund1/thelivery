# CLAUDE.md — Livery Catalog

Guidance for working in this repository. Read this before making changes.

## What this is

A catalog of Forza car liveries. It was **migrated from a single 17 MB HTML file**
(now in `archive/livery_catalog_edited.html`, kept locally / gitignored) into a
data-driven app:

- **`frontend/`** — Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript + Pinia SPA.
- **`backend/`** — Rust (Axum) + SQLite (SQLx) API; in production it also serves the built SPA.
- **`tools/extract/`** — one-time Node script that parsed the original HTML into seed data + images.
- **`deploy/`** — systemd unit, deploy script, and Caddy/TLS setup for the DigitalOcean droplet.

Live at **https://thelivery.silverleaf.services** (Caddy terminates TLS, reverse-proxies to the backend).

## The data model is the center of everything

One `Livery` object (see `frontend/src/types.ts`) drives the DB rows, the API, the
Pinia store, and the components. This is the schema the original HTML encoded implicitly through the DOM:

```ts
interface Livery {
  id: string                 // "1".."6", "legend"
  catalogNumber: number
  name: string
  subtitle: string
  isFavorite: boolean
  isLegend: boolean          // the "legend" template card
  collections: string[]      // e.g. FH5, FH6, Drift, Street, Photo Safari
  tags: string[]
  images: { id, path, isLead, order }[]   // path = "/uploads/<file>"
  inspiration: { body, figurePath? }
  designNotes: { body, figurePath? }
  recipe: {
    tuneName, shareCode,
    coreSpecs: Record<string,string>,     // Drivetrain/Engine/Transmission/Tires/Suspension
    upgrades: { category, parts[] }[],
    adjustments: { name, description }[],
  }
}
```

When adding a field, thread it through: `types.ts` → the relevant component → (it
persists automatically, since the backend stores the whole object as JSON).

## Running locally

Two processes. From the repo root:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend on :8787 (creates/seeds data.db on first run)
cd backend && cargo run

# Terminal 2 — frontend dev server on :5173 (proxies /api and /uploads to :8787)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Vite's proxy (`frontend/vite.config.ts`) forwards `/api`
and `/uploads` to the backend, so the app always uses same-origin relative URLs.

**Reset to clean seed data:** stop the backend, `rm backend/data.db`, restart.

## Build / typecheck / verify

- **Frontend:** `npm --prefix frontend run build` runs `vue-tsc -b && vite build`. This is the typecheck gate — run it after frontend changes.
- **Backend:** `cd backend && cargo build`. For the production target: `cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` (needs `musl-tools`; set `CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=musl-gcc`).
- **No automated test suite exists.** Verify by building, by curling the API, and by the production-simulation pattern (run the release binary with `FRONTEND_DIR`/`UPLOADS_DIR`/`SEED_PATH`/`DATABASE_PATH` set and curl `/`, `/api/liveries`, `/uploads/...`).
- `frontend/shot.mjs` is a Playwright screenshot helper, but headless Chromium needs system libs (`libnspr4`, etc.) that require root to install — it won't run here without that.

## Backend (`backend/`)

- **Axum + SQLx (SQLite).** Single file: `backend/src/main.rs`.
- **Storage model:** one row per livery in the `liveries` table — `id`, `catalog_number`, and `body` (the full `Livery` JSON). Reads/writes are whole-object; the API hands the frontend an array of these JSON objects verbatim.
- **Endpoints:** `GET/PUT/POST/DELETE /api/liveries[/:id]`, `POST /api/images` (multipart upload → returns `{ path }`), `GET /api/health`, static `/uploads/*`, and (production) the SPA at everything else.
- **Serving the SPA:** `ServeDir::new(FRONTEND_DIR).not_found_service(ServeFile::new(index.html))`. Real files (index, hashed assets) serve at 200; unknown paths return index.html with a 404 status — acceptable because the app has **no client-side router** (only `/` is a real entry point). Don't "fix" this with `ServeDir::fallback` — that broke static serving entirely in this tower-http version.
- **Config via env** (set by the systemd unit in prod):
  - `BIND_ADDR` (default `0.0.0.0`; prod `127.0.0.1`), `PORT` (default `8787`)
  - `DATABASE_PATH`, `UPLOADS_DIR`, `SEED_PATH`, `FRONTEND_DIR`
- **Seeding:** on first run, if `liveries` is empty, it imports `backend/seed/liveries.json`.
- **Migrations:** SQLx migrations in `backend/migrations/`. **Never edit an applied migration — always add a new one** (`sqlx migrate add <desc>`). This matches the global rule about migrations.

## Frontend (`frontend/src/`)

### Stack & layout
- Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, Pinia stores, TypeScript. Entry: `main.ts` (registers Pinia + the global `v-tip` directive).
- **State lives in Pinia, never in the DOM** (the original was the opposite). Two stores:
  - `stores/liveries.ts` — the `Livery[]` data + mutations + API calls (`load`, `save`, per-card snapshots).
  - `stores/ui.ts` — theme, text size, edit mode, expand/collapse, filters, which modal is open, and the **per-card dirty set**.

### CSS — important
- **All styling is one global stylesheet, `src/styles/catalog.css`, copied verbatim from the original HTML.** Components reuse those exact class names. **Do not rename classes or convert to scoped styles** — visual parity depends on the global rules. Scoped `<style>` is only for genuinely new bits (e.g. the per-card save button, unsaved-count).
- **Themes:** `data-theme` on `<html>` swaps ~35 CSS variables; 5 themes (dark/light/rainbow/clouds/stormy). Two live knobs: `--text-delta` (text scaling) and `--dissolve` (crossfade).
- **Edit-only affordances** (chip add/remove, lead-star, change-image, contenteditable styling) are `display:none` until `body.editing-mode` — so render them in markup always; the `ui.isEditing` watcher toggles the body class.

### Component tree
`App.vue` → `SideBug` (+ `Filters` slot), `EditBar`, and a `v-for` of `LiveryCard`, plus global modals (`Lightbox`, `ChipPicker`, `ImagePicker`, `ExitConfirmModal`, `CustomTip`).
`LiveryCard` → `CardMeta`, `Gallery`, `TagCloud`, three `CollapsibleSection`s (Inspiration, Design Notes, Recipe → `RecipeSection`). Reusable: `EditableText`.

### Edit mode + per-card persistence
- **Per-card save:** each card shows a Save button in edit mode (`CardMeta`). `ui.saveCard(id)` PUTs that one livery and clears its dirty flag. There is no global "save all" button; the exit prompt handles saving on the way out.
- **Dirty tracking is per card** (`ui.dirtyIds: Set<string>`). `LiveryCard` `provide`s a `MarkDirtyKey` (`keys.ts`) bound to its id; descendant editors (notably `EditableText`) `inject` and call it. Components that already have the livery id call `ui.markCardDirty(id)` directly. The global pickers (`ChipPicker`/`ImagePicker`) use the id from their context (`ui.chipPicker`/`ui.imagePicker`).
- **Snapshots are per-card baselines** (`liveries.ts`): entering edit mode snapshots every card; saving a card refreshes *its* baseline; "Discard and Exit" reverts each card to its baseline — so a card you already saved is not rolled back.
- `EditableText` writes content to the DOM imperatively (not via `{{ }}`) so typing never resets the caret; it syncs external changes back in only when not focused.

### Slideshow (`composables/useSlideshow.ts` + `Gallery.vue`)
- **Autoplay only while the card is ≥50% visible** (IntersectionObserver): resumes on enter, suspends on exit. Manual pause is **sticky** (`userPaused`) — pausing or clicking a thumbnail/stage keeps it paused across scrolling until you press play.
- **Reveal/dissolve choreography:** on entering view the play button shows "Autoplaying" over a grounded progress bar, then slow-fades out (`BUTTON_REVEAL` → `BUTTON_FADE`) as autoplay starts; the `.stage.settled` CSS class drives button visibility.
- **GOTCHA — thumb rail:** keep the active thumbnail in view by setting `thumbs.scrollLeft` directly. **Do not use `scrollIntoView`** — `block:'nearest'` walks up the scroll chain and jumps the whole page (this caused a real "page won't stop jumping" bug across the multiple autoplaying galleries).

### Custom tooltips (`composables/tooltip.ts` + `CustomTip.vue`)
- One shared tooltip element + a global `v-tip` directive. It drawer-slides open (width 0 → content width), snaps shut before reopening for a new target, and closes on scroll — all via imperative DOM + `requestAnimationFrame`, ported from the original. `v-tip` takes a string or a `() => string` (evaluated on each hover for live state like favorited/theme/expand).

### vue-tsc gotcha
String template refs (`ref="x"`) aren't counted as "used" by `vue-tsc`'s unused-locals check. When a composable needs an element ref, create it in the component and **pass it into the composable** (so it's read in script) — see `Gallery.vue` passing `stageRef`/`barRef`/`toggleRef` into `useSlideshow`.

## Images

- Stored as files under `backend/uploads/`, served at `/uploads/*`; DB rows hold the relative path.
- The seed images were decoded from the original HTML's base64. **The data URIs claimed `image/png` but the bytes are JPEG** — `tools/extract/extract.mjs` sniffs magic bytes for the real extension. Re-run extraction only if needed (`cd tools/extract && npm run extract`); it reads `archive/livery_catalog_edited.html` (kept locally, not in the repo).
- `backend/uploads/` is **tracked in git** (the seed set), so a fresh clone runs as-is. Production deploys **never overwrite** `data.db` or uploaded images (seed images are copied in only if missing).

## Deployment

- **Push to `main`** triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: builds the static musl backend + the frontend, bundles them with seed data + the systemd unit, rsyncs to the droplet, and runs `deploy/remote-deploy.sh` (idempotent installer).
- In production the **single binary** serves API + `/uploads` + SPA on `127.0.0.1:8787`; **Caddy** (installed once via `deploy/setup-caddy.sh <domain>`) terminates TLS on 443 and reverse-proxies to it, auto-renewing the Let's Encrypt cert.
- Required GitHub secrets: `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`, `DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USER` (passwordless sudo). The droplet runs the service as a dedicated `thelivery` user under `/opt/thelivery`.
- After a push, you can confirm the live build updated by checking the asset hash in `frontend/dist/index.html` against `https://thelivery.silverleaf.services/`.

## Conventions & rules

- **Git:** never auto-commit; commit only when asked (this repo's branch is `main`). End commit messages with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- **Migrations:** new migration files only; never edit applied ones.
- **Don't break visual parity:** keep `catalog.css` and its class names intact; the original single-file app in `archive/` is the reference to diff against.
- After frontend changes, run `npm --prefix frontend run build` (typecheck) before considering it done; after backend changes, `cargo build`.
- Keep edits same-origin and relative (`/api`, `/uploads`) — never hardcode hosts/ports in the frontend.
