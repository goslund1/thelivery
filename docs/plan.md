### 2. Photo Manager overlay — unified import and pool management

**~~Complete~~ — done 2026-07-13. Core built (commit 3b4cee4), Escape flash fixed (d1ed193), gallery carId pre-fill (589b7c9), figure-pick session car (6ea1a26), multi-car detection on [change] (d2e748e). All gaps resolved.**

**Design spec (settled 2026-07-12)**

All photo-related actions across the app converge on one modal overlay: the Photo Manager. It replaces the scattered upload paths in NewCardModal, Gallery folder import, and the figure picker's bare file inputs, and expands ImagePicker into the full management surface.

#### What it is

A single overlay (expands the existing `ImagePicker` component) with three areas:

**Main area — image pool grid**
All images associated with the card, regardless of role. Thumbnails support drag-to-reorder, included/excluded toggle (slideshow visibility), per-image delete, and click-to-open PhotoDetail. This is what ImagePicker already renders — no structural change needed, just needs to stay the center of the overlay.

**Top bar — game + role chips**
`FH5` · `FH6` · `+IMG` chips live here. These set the carId context for the current upload session:
- **FH5 / FH6**: opens that game's car list (CarPicker disambiguation). Once a car is selected, carId is set for the session. All subsequent uploads in this overlay session auto-tag to that car without re-prompting.
- **+IMG**: bypasses the make/model path entirely. Marks incoming files as `image_role = 'refimg'`, `included = false`. No carId required.
- **Session carId pill**: once a car is selected, the chip area collapses to a pill showing the car name with a [change] button. Tapping [change] re-opens the full CarPicker. If the user picks a *different* car, multi-car detection fires and the CarTabs wizard is offered (same as today).
- **Existing card with carId already set**: the pill is pre-populated on open. The user can proceed with the same car or hit [change] to start a new vehicle round.

**Side panel — import progress**
Appears while files are uploading; collapses when idle. Shows per-file progress rows (filename + progress bar + status), mirroring ImageMigrationModal's log style. Fades out or collapses to a summary when all uploads complete.

#### Modes

- **Pick mode**: opened from a figure section (inspiration / design notes). Clicking a thumbnail picks it as the figure image and closes the overlay. "Upload new" drops into the same pool flow — file lands in the pool, auto-selected as the figure pick.
- **Manage mode**: opened from the gallery edit button or a "Manage photos" action. Full management — reorder, toggle, delete, batch select, upload more. No figure selection.

#### Entry points → all open the same overlay

| Trigger | Mode | carId pre-fill |
|---|---|---|
| Figure picker (inspiration / notes) | Pick | card's carId if set |
| Gallery "add photos" / folder drop (edit mode) | Manage | card's carId if set |
| "Manage photos" button | Manage | card's carId if set |
| New card — first photo action | Manage | none (chips required) |

#### NewCardModal changes

- The staged-file holding area and "Import →" batch button are removed. Photo management moves entirely into the Photo Manager overlay, opened the first time the user takes a photo action.
- The final action button becomes **"Create Card"** — it commits the card metadata and saves. Photos are already in the pool by this point.
- The `imageRole` local ref and the figure-picker pre-upload workaround (`openFigurePicker` auto-upload that was hardcoding `'refimg'`) are no longer needed once the overlay owns all upload paths.

#### Key invariant

**CarPicker disambiguation always happens inside the overlay, at upload time, not before.** No pre-form setup required. The session carId persists for the duration of the overlay session so repeated uploads to the same car need only one disambiguation step.

### 2. Finish CarTabs implementation (in progress)
See `docs/plan-cartabs-tunetabs.md` for the full action plan covering steps 1–4.
CarTabs wizard and tab strip UI are built. The following gaps remain before the mashup feature is shippable:

- ~~**Figure image near recipe**~~ — done. Lead image for the active carId appears before the tune name (48px tall, hover shows 200px preview, click opens lightbox). Tune name falls back to `'YY Model` when empty in multi-car mode. Share code is click-to-copy in view mode.
- ~~**Discipline preset values**~~ — done 2026-07-13. Race/Rally/Drift/Street baseline presets seeded. Jason to refine values when ready.
- ~~**NewCardModal multi-car detection**~~ — done. After a successful photo import, modal pauses and shows "Done / + Add another car" instead of auto-closing. Each additional round creates a new livery on the same card. RecipeSection's auto-propose banner handles tab setup once 2+ carIds are present in the photos.
- ~~**Shakedown pass**~~ — done. Two bugs found and fixed: (1) spurious Springs dialog on tab switch (`_inPropUpdate` + `flush:'sync'` in TuningAdjustments); (2) tune-name invisible when empty in edit mode (placeholder prop on EditableText). Save/restore round-trip, discard, tab deletion, single-car cards unaffected — all confirmed. — 2026-07-12

---

### 2. Car → Tunes hierarchy (design revision — supersedes either/or mode)
The original "cars mode vs tunes mode" design (implicit from data shape, flat `variants[]` array) is replaced with a proper two-level hierarchy:

```
Card
  └─ Car (0 to many, identified by carId)
       └─ Tune (1 to many per car, named: Race / Rally / Drift / etc.)
            └─ Slider tab group (Alignment, Gearing, Aero, etc.)
```

**Why this is better:** Every car can have multiple tunes. A single-car card with one tune is just the degenerate case (1 car, 1 tune). A Smokin-style mashup is 3 cars × N tunes each. The either/or framing was an artificial constraint.

**Data model change required:**
- Current: flat `variants[]` array on the recipe, mode inferred from whether carIds are distinct
- New: `cars[]` where each car entry has its own `tunes[]` array. Each tune carries a name + the full recipe payload (upgrades, adjustments, specs, share code). The existing slider tab groups (Alignment, Gearing, etc.) sit inside each tune — unchanged structurally, just nested one level deeper.

**TuneTabs — new module, parallel to CarTabs:**
- CarTabs is the UI for navigating between cars on a card. TuneTabs is the UI for navigating between tunes within a single car.
- Both use the same folder-tab visual pattern. TuneTabs is a new but similar module — same tab strip component, scoped to a car context rather than the card.
- CarTabs wizard (already built) handles the car-level setup. A TuneTabs authoring flow handles adding/naming tune variants per car — triggered from within a car tab, not at the card level.
- A single-car card with one tune renders no tab strips at all (current default behavior, unchanged).

**Implementation order:**
1. ~~Finish item 1 (current CarTabs shakedown) first~~ — done
2. ~~Design the `cars[]` data shape and migration path~~ — done 2026-07-13 (Step 3 complete)
3. ~~Build TuneTabs UI and authoring flow~~ — done 2026-07-13 (Step 4 complete)

**Backend migration note:**
The `variants[]` array lives in the card's JSON body, so no new SQL migration is needed. However, `normalize_bodies()` in `backend/src/main.rs` will need a new step to reshape existing `variants[]` flat arrays into the `cars[]` nested structure. Smokin is currently the only card with variants, so the migration surface is small — but it must go through `normalize_bodies()` (idempotent, runs on startup) rather than a one-time manual DB patch. See CLAUDE.md → "Seeding" for the normalize_bodies pattern.

**Deferred — community tune scrape + compare:**
- Park until app is live and primary content is established.

### 3. AI low-balance alert — discuss and plan
Before the catalog scales up and image imports become frequent, we need a proactive warning when Anthropic credit is running low — not just a toast when it's already gone.

**Questions to answer before building:**
- Does the Anthropic API expose a balance or usage endpoint queryable with an API key? If yes, the backend can poll it on a schedule and fire an alert at a threshold. If no, the only trigger is catching a 429/quota error in the assess endpoint.
- What's the notification target? Options: email (needs SMTP or a mail API), push (needs a webhook service like Pushover or ntfy), or both via a `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK` env var the backend POSTs to.
- What threshold triggers the alert — a fixed dollar amount, a percentage of last top-up, or just "first time we hit a 429"?

**Rough shape once answers are settled:**
- `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK` env var in the systemd unit
- Backend fires a POST on quota error AND (if balance API exists) on a scheduled low-balance check
- No frontend changes needed

See Maintenance → AI billing notification for context.

### 4. Mobile layout
Narrow-screen pass for the full catalog. Known gaps:
- Theme builder flyout — doesn't fit on small screens
- General card layout on narrow viewports
- Deferred until now; no blocking dependencies remaining

---

## Maintenance

### Pre-launch checklist
- **Lock CORS to production domain** — currently `CorsLayer::permissive()` in `backend/src/main.rs`. Change to `CorsLayer::new().allow_origin("https://thelivery.silverleaf.services")` before public launch.
- **Update README.md** — significantly out of date: still references `/api/liveries` (now `/api/cards`), `seed/liveries.json` (now `seed/cards.json`), "single-user, no auth" (JWT auth exists), and is missing most current endpoints. Rewrite the API table and data description to match reality before the repo goes public.

### Backfill pass (another round coming)
- Card data was brought in line once. The next structural change is the Cars→Tunes hierarchy refactor (active item 2) which will reshape card body data again. Hold off on a full backfill pass until that data model stabilizes — otherwise it's two passes.
- Done in-app via EditCardModal; revisit when the dust settles.

### AI billing notification (planned, lower priority)
- See active item 3 for the discussion and planning work needed before this gets built.
- When `assess-color` hits a 429 or quota error, the toast already surfaces it in-app. What's missing is a *proactive* low-balance alert before hitting zero.
- Implementation shape is roughly settled (NOTIFY_WEBHOOK env var, POST on quota error + optional scheduled balance check) but key questions remain — see active item 3.

### Deferred
- **`car_colors`** — factory *stock* color options per car model (e.g. "this Corvette comes in Arctic White, Rapid Blue..."). Requires scraping Forza wikis. Not to be confused with `primary_color`/`secondary_color` on the `liveries` table, which is the AI livery color assessment already wired into the import flow. No ETA on car_colors.

## Recently completed

- **Code audit pass 4** — six fixes across compositor, OG Maker, ShareModal, auth: `@input` on content field for live preview; scrim overlap check; `as any` removed from ShareModal; `list_og_presets` auth-gated; `render_glyphs` + `blit_with_transform` extracted (−75 lines); `TextStyle` enum + `OgTextStyle` union replace magic strings. Deferred: circular store import warning (`ui.ts` ↔ `modal.ts`). — 2026-07-16 (commit b3214b2, AAR: `docs/aar-2026-07-16b.md`)

- **OG overlay access fixed** — ShareModal OG design section now gated by `auth.isAuthenticated` instead of `ui.isEditing`. Admins see the overlay composer in normal user view (click card title → Share modal) — the correct flow since sharing is a post-edit action, and the title is an editable input in edit mode. Also added `/share` to the Vite dev proxy so the compositor preview and share routes work in local dev. — 2026-07-16

- **OG Overlay Studio** — server-generated 1200×630 `og:image` for social share unfurls (Discord, iMessage, Reddit). Pure-Rust compositor (`fontdue` + `image` crate): `POST /share/preview` for live OG Maker preview, `GET /share/:id/card.png` for public card image, `og_presets` table + CRUD. Three text styles: POSTCARD (Bebas Neue, floating), SIGNAL (Oswald VF + dark chyron backdrop), GHOST (Oswald VF, semi-transparent). Polish: bottom scrim gradient, per-style drop shadows, logo slot ("THE LIVERY" placeholder). OG Maker modal: freely-positioned text boxes with corner-resize, rotation handle, shear slider; 200ms debounced live preview; preset save + "Save to Card." ShareModal integration with preset picker, preview thumbnails, Adjust/Reset flow. — 2026-07-16

- **CarTabs/TuneTabs shakedown + polish**: discipline baseline presets (Race/Rally/Drift/Street) seeded in DB; `+ ADD CAR` / `+ ADD TUNE` buttons styled as dashed tabs (grey→gold/pink on hover); TuneTabs shelf color = `--highlight`; spacing and gap fixes; `v-tip-up` directive for right-flying tooltip from text end; card title opens ShareModal. — 2026-07-13
- **Social sharing foundation + Reddit pre-fill**: OG share page endpoint (`GET /share/:id/:slug`) added to Rust backend — server-rendered HTML with full OG + Twitter card tags; real browsers get `<meta refresh>` to `/`. Card title opens `ShareModal` (view mode only, `v-tip-up` tooltip). Modal: Copy Link button (clipboard API, 2s feedback) + **Post to Reddit** (pre-fill approach — opens `reddit.com/submit?url=…&title=…` in new tab with editable title pre-populated from card + car name + share code; Reddit's native form handles subreddit selection and posting) + Discord stub. Note: direct Reddit API posting blocked — Reddit ended self-service OAuth access Nov 2025 for personal projects. See `docs/plan-reddit-share.md`. — 2026-07-13

- **CarTabs shakedown + bug fixes**: spurious Springs and Dampers dialog on tab switch fixed (`_inPropUpdate` flag + `flush:'sync'` on gearCount watcher in TuningAdjustments — prevents prop-driven gearCount change from calling checkImplied); tune-name placeholder added to EditableText (CSS `::before` + `data-placeholder` attr) so empty tuneName in edit mode shows the car model name as hint text. — 2026-07-12
- **Gear preset fix + preset kind** (migration 0016): `applyPresetValues`, `executeApplyPreset`, and `saveAsPreset` all now include locked gear rows — previously skipped them, so presets saved/applied without Race Transmission had no gear values. `getAdjustments()` now includes locked rows so gear values survive the flush→rebuild cycle. `applyImpliedTransmission()` added: infers required transmission from highest `gearN` key in preset, auto-adds it via `implied-upgrades` emit (mirrors `onTransChoice` pattern). Rally preset (id=6) was saved while locked and has no gear keys — needs a re-save after adding Race Transmission. Migration 0016 adds `kind TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'build'` to `tuning_presets`; Baseline checkbox in save dialog; `◆` prefix on baseline entries in dropdown. Baseline/build conflict logic (skip baseline-locked rows when applying a build preset) deferred until first real baseline preset exists. — 2026-07-11
- **RefImg pipeline** (migration 0015): `image_role` + `included` columns on images table; `included` now persists across page reloads (was ephemeral). RefImg images get structured filenames `{card_slug}_RefImg{NN}_{date}_{uuid6}`, default to excluded from slideshow, skip livery creation + color assess. CarPicker gets `+IMG` button (`showImageBtn` prop, dashed style) that emits `select-image` — no car search. NewCardModal tracks `imageRole`, shows RefImg chip, passes role to uploads. `sync_card_images` now syncs `included` back to DB on card save. — 2026-07-11
- **NewCardModal car/recipe parity**: `RecipeSection` gets `forceEdit` prop so all edit-mode fields (CarPicker, spec table, upgrades, preset bar) appear in NewCardModal without requiring global edit mode. — 2026-07-11
- Replaced `vue-virtual-scroller` with plain `v-for` (all filtered cards always mounted). Virtual scroll's slot-pool model is incompatible with stateful Vue components — two failure modes (slot recycling + concurrent duplicate slots) required module-level singleton workarounds that added permanent complexity. At catalog scale the memory cost of mounting all cards is negligible. `useCardVisibility.ts` (IntersectionObserver + KeepAlive) left in place for when the catalog is large enough to need lazy mounting. See `CLAUDE.md` → "Card list rendering" — 2026-07-10
- Settings/Admin UI reorganization: Account panel (change password + Add User gated behind toggles, Admin Panel → button, Sign Out); separate Admin panel with Tools tab (image tools, stats, orphans, trash, seed) + Export Card tab (YAML download/import, legacy repair at bottom); Tune Suggestions stays in Filters flyout only — 2026-07-07
- figurePath patching in migration flow: ImageMigrationModal snapshots old paths and patches TextSection.figurePath after migrate; Repair Figure Paths endpoint matches by sequence number before falling back to lead image — 2026-07-07
- Trash compactor: orphans scan moves to trash instead of hard-delete; user-deleted images move to trash on card save; GET/DELETE /api/admin/trash + POST /api/admin/trash/restore; trash_log table (migration 0012); reason badges, select/restore/delete — 2026-07-06
- Security & quality audit: fixed orphan scanner (queried card body instead of images table), delete_images legacy variant naming, orphan scan skips uploads/trash/, rate limit HashMap growth, suggestion adjustments 64KB cap, e:any catches — 2026-07-06
- Car Tabs wizard: floating modal walks through each non-anchor car, user picks a tuning preset per car, creates tabs with pendingPresetId, auto-applies on first tab open — 2026-07-08
- Tab strip UX polish: delete 2→1 leaves last tab visible, delete last collapses to clean state + re-activates Car tabs button, short model-name labels with full name on hover title — 2026-07-08
- Folder tab visual styling: gold shelf via container border-bottom, all tabs margin-bottom:-1px, active tab border-bottom-color:var(--panel) to erase shelf beneath it — 2026-07-08 (NOTE: took ~1hr and significant token burn due to Claude inventing z-index/pseudo-element schemes instead of researching the standard CSS pattern first. Jason's feedback: research known UI patterns before writing code, present the approach for sign-off before executing.)
- CollapsibleSection HMR sync fix: immediate:true on store watch so expand/collapse state survives hot reload — 2026-07-08
- Multi-car mashup foundation: tab strip, auto-propose banner, + button consolidation, gallery carId filtering — 2026-07-06
- Image migration pipeline: full re-file + rename, all 11 cards migrated, structured filenames, drum CarPicker, toast drawer, dotenvy, FH6 FD cars, Bronco R — 2026-07-06
- Car identity model: cars table, CarPicker, PhotoDetail, livery picker, AI color assess, Step 8 hardening — 2026-07-06
- Image identity refactor: images table as source of truth, integer PKs, inject_images on read, sync on write, ImageMigrationModal — 2026-07-05
- Suggest bar two-tier trigger, card accent override, per-section defaultOpen, RecipeSection one-way flow, code quality passes 1 + 2 — 2026-07-05
- Transmission/gearing system, TuningAdjustments Define Stock + undo, ThemeBuilder effects sliders — 2026-07-04
- Theme builder + ColorPicker, DrawerPanel, card history, YAML export/import, suggest bar two-surface redesign — earlier sessions
